3. Create a config.php file in the root of the cloned repository and set up the necessary database connection details, such as the username, password, host, and database name.
4. Run `docker-compose build` in the project root directory to build the server and database containers.
5. Run `docker-compose up -d` in the project root directory to start the server and database containers in the background (detached mode) and run `docker-compose down` to stop them. You can also use `docker-compose up` to start the containers in the foreground and see the logs.
